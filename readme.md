This is the Matlab code to replicate the results in the paper  	arXiv:2110.09361. It requires the **GP_toolbox** (https://github.com/TristanFauvel/GP_toolbox) and the **BO_toobox** (https://github.com/TristanFauvel/BO_toolbox).


## Numerical experiments
To run the numerical experiments as described in the paper, use:

## Figures and tables
To plot the figures and create the tables in LaTeX, use:
- Figure 1: uncertainty.m  
- Figure 2, Figure S1, Tables 1 : BBO_results.m
- Figure 3, Figure S4, Tables 3 : batch_BBO_results.m
- Figure S2, Figure S3, Tables 2: PBO_results.m
- Figure S5: FigureS5.m  
- Figure S6: FigureS6.m
